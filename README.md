# Recursive File Copying and Sorting

This Python module provides a command-line utility for recursively copying files from a source directory to a destination directory while sorting them based on their file extensions.

## Description

The script uses the `os`, `shutil`, and `argparse` modules to recursively traverse the source directory, copy files to the destination directory, and organize them into subdirectories based on their file extensions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Provide the source directory path as the first argument.
4. Optionally, provide the destination directory path as the second argument (default is "dist").

## Example

```bash
python3 file_copy_sort.py /path/to/source_directory /path/to/destination_directory
```


# Koch Snowflake Fractal Generator

This Python module generates the Koch snowflake fractal using recursion and the turtle graphics library.

## Description

The Koch snowflake is a mathematical fractal that looks like a snowflake. It is constructed using an iterative process with recursive calls to draw smaller segments of the snowflake.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Enter the desired recursion level when prompted.

## Example

```bash
python3 koch_snowflake.py
