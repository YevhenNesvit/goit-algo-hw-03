# Koch Snowflake Fractal Generator

This Python module generates the Koch snowflake fractal using recursion and the turtle graphics library.

## Description

The Koch snowflake is a mathematical fractal that looks like a snowflake. It is constructed using an iterative process with recursive calls to draw smaller segments of the snowflake.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Enter the desired recursion level when prompted.

## Example

```bash
python koch_snowflake.py
ʼʼʼbash
